    val text = "You don’t need a hot tub time machine to tell you that we are in the midst of an ’80s pop-culture revival. It’s hardly surprising, since the kids who grew up watching the movies and television of that decade — “The A-Team” and “The Karate Kid,” to restrict ourselves to films opening this week — are now old enough to make and approve projects of their own. A lot of franchises that started out back in those kind-of-innocent, not-so-simple times have kept on going ever since. “The Terminator,” for instance, and Bruce Willis.\n\nBut the new “Karate Kid” is not driven completely by nostalgia. The first movie, released in 1984, with Pat Morita as the wise old mentor and Ralph Macchio as his protégé, tapped into so many archetypes (the polite word for clichés) that it could have been made at any time. The new version duplicates its story, but moves the action to China, where the title character, a 12-year-old named Dre (Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, producers on the film), has moved with his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson).\n\nThe relocation turns out to make a big difference. “The Karate Kid” is very long ( 2 hours 12 minutes), dramatically thin and unevenly acted, but it was filmed almost entirely in China, mostly Beijing, and it has an unexotic, lived-in sense of place unusual in current Hollywood movies. (And this is not quite a Hollywood movie, but rather a Chinese-American co-production.) There are visits to the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and a mountain temple, but mostly there is the lively bustle of workaday Beijing.\n\nDre and Sherry have moved there from Detroit, fleeing sad memories of Dre’s father’s death and seeking the kind of job opportunity that has vanished from the Motor City. It is a rough transition for Dre. He falls victim to a group of bullies whose ringleader is Cheng (Wang Zhenwei), a star pupil at a quasi-fascist kung fu academy. Dre’s crush on Mei Ying (Han Wenwen), an aspiring violinist, does not help matters, since she’s a childhood friend of Cheng, the main bully.\n\nEnter, grumbling and shuffling, a humble handyman who turns out to be Jackie Chan. You don’t have to be familiar with the first “Karate Kid” — or even with the trailer for this one — to know what will happen. There will be rigorous training, beginning with the repetition of a simple, menial task, in this case taking off and hanging up a jacket (rather than the car waxing in the first movie). There will be revelations, misunderstandings and montage sequences that somehow do not make the story go any faster. Then the final showdown with the bad kung fu kids (shouldn’t it be called “The Kung Fu Kid”?). Honor restored. Revenge exacted. Tears shed. Lessons learned.\n\nAs I said: archetypal. And not so terrible, especially for younger children not yet jaded by repeated exposure to triumph-of-the-underdog sports movies. But it should have been better, with a richer sense of the relationships between Dre and the adults in his life, and a sense of cultural curiosity to match the eager geographical exploration. It doesn’t help that Ms. Henson, by far the most dynamic presence in the film — but you could say that about almost anything she’s in, like “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and “Hustle & Flow” — is limited to a few scenes of scolding and worrying.\nAnd the director, Harald Zwart (“The Pink Panther 2”), does not make enough use of Mr. Chan’s best assets, namely his deadpan features and whirling limbs. His awkwardness in English would be less of a problem if Jaden Smith were not such a stiff, recessive actor. He can be lively and charming, but it is not always possible to tell where Dre’s cool, self-protective demeanor stops and Jaden’s limitations begin.\n\nStill, you have no choice but to root for him — the actor and the young kung fu adept. Is this “Karate Kid” as good as the original? No, although it is better than the sequels. But why bother with nostalgia? It’s probably good enough.\n\n“The Karate Kid” is rated PG. It has bullying and fighting." + "In many ways, The Karate Kid is the perfect remake: faithful to the source material in large part yet offering enough nuanced differences to allow it to stand on its own. The problem with the film is that that story, hackneyed when it first made it to the screen in 1984, has grown only more tired over the past 26 years. The film adheres so rigorously to the typical sports-movie clichés, with the downtrodden underdog facing off against the bullying favorite in a major tournament after finding a wise mentor and undergoing a long training process, that instances of freshness can be found only in the margins. The Karate Kid would be no less familiar if it wasn't a remake.\n\nThe biggest change between the 1984 edition and its 2010 successor is in tone. When Ralph Macchio wore the mantle of the title character, the approach was generally lighthearted and occasionally cheesy. In the remake, we have entered the Valley of Darkness. This is a grim motion picture. The bullies are more vicious than their predecessors, the Karate Kid rarely smiles or jokes, and the mentor's dour demeanor veils a deep tragedy. Given today's society's predisposition toward the serious and cynical, the change to The Karate Kid's tone is warranted. It grounds the movie and prevents it from coming across as a self-parody. The trade-off - one some viewers will surely disagree with - is that the sense of innocence that permeated the 1984 version is gone. Despite the PG-rating and the reduction in age of the protagonist (from high school to junior high), The Karate Kid 2010 is a more adult production than its forebear.\n\nIn 1984, the main character experienced the culture shock associated with changing coasts - moving from New Jersey to California. Here, this aspect of the story has been amplified to create a true \"fish out of water\" scenario, with Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) traveling alongside his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson), from the United States to China. In his new home, Dre is unable to speak the language, which limits his associations to those who know at least a little English. This includes the school bully, Cheng, who takes an instant dislike to Dre; a pretty girl, Meiying, who has the opposite reaction; and the apartment maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who spies a hidden promise in Dre. From there, the story unfolds as expected: the conflict between Cheng and Dre escalates, with the latter repeatedly getting the short end of the stick; Dre learns that Mr. Han is a kung-fu master and pleads with the taciturn man to teach him; class and cultural differences threaten to derail Dre's burgeoning relationship with Meiying; the training is more mundane than Dre expects; and everything builds toward the final showdown with Cheng. You don't have to see the movie to know how it ends. In fact, you don't need to have seen any movie with the words \"Karate Kid\" in the title to predict with 100% accuracy how events will be resolved. One could argue that such certainty is a part of the movie's charm. Or a key aspect of its weakness.\n\nThe decision to \"de-age\" the main character by about four years works within the context of the story. Dre is not so young that a light romance with Meiying is out of place, but his youth allows him to be vulnerable and to react with limited maturity. Where Macchio's Daniel was angry about being forced to move from home, Dre is hurt and lost. His cockiness disappears rapidly following his first beating at the hands of Cheng. It helps that Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, is an adept performer with natural charisma.\n\nJackie Chan's Mr. Han bears only a passing resemblance to Pat Morita's Mr. Miyagi. Much of the humor associated with Miyagi has been left behind, which is surprising since Chan is as much a comedian as an action star. A poignant incident in Miyagi's past has been expanded into a full-blown tragedy for Han, whose dour reticence is easily explained by this turn of events. Chan is a good actor and this role allows him to show a more dramatic persona than many of his fans will recognize; this is also an opportunity for him to use his martial arts skills in a manner befitting someone of his age. It's no longer believable to see Chan involved in intricately choreographed fights, but teaching a kid is no stretch.\n\nOne significant misstep made by the remake is how the act of physical repetition within Dre's training is approached. In the original The Karate Kid, Daniel was forced into doing a number of chores - waxing a car, sanding a deck, painting a fence and house - that appeared to benefit Miyagi but, in reality, were tasks designed to build and train his muscles. In the new movie, his single action - picking up a sweatshirt and hanging it on a peg - follows the pattern of the 1984 movie but loses the essence. The pointlessness of the sweatshirt routine, coupled with its limited association with the moves Dre learns, botches an element that previously worked.\n\nThere are some explicit nods to the 1984 movie. The title, The Karate Kid, is one. Although Daniel learned a variation of karate from Mr. Miyagi, Dre's martial art of choice is kung-fu. While Mr. Han never utters the iconic phrase \"wax on, wax off,\" he is shown in one scene to apply wax to a car using a circular motion. There's also a sequence when he uses chopsticks in an attempt to capture a fly; however, after growing impatient, he employs a fly-swatter.\n\nGenerally, remakes fall somewhere on a spectrum of \"brilliant re-creation\" to \"embarrassing waste-of-time.\" Although the uninspired resume of director Harald Zwart (whose previous efforts include Agent Cody Banks and The Pink Panther 2) might lead one to expect the worst, The Karate Kid falls somewhere in the middle. It is redundant and unnecessary but it's also inoffensive and does nothing to damage the reputation of the original. Despite the roughness of the violence (which probably should have resulted in a PG-13 rating), The Karate Kid offers something for nostalgic parents and children who don't want to see an \"old\" movie. It's perfectly adequate, which might be the best one could hope for given the source material." + "When a child star is cute and has a few instinctual acting moves, that’s probably enough to get him by. Jaden Smith, who stars in the new remake of The Karate Kid, scores on both counts, but he also has something that’s rare to see in a child actor. He’s got presence. As Dre Parker, a pensive and fatherless 12-year-old from Detroit whose mother (Taraji P. Henson) gets transferred to the forbidding city of Beijing (the extreme move isn’t really explained — I mean, couldn’t she have been sent off to, you know, Denver?), Smith holds the screen while doing next to nothing, just standing there, silent and inquisitive, trying to figure out an angle on the situation that’s closing in on him.\n\nSmith, of course, is the son of Hollywood royalty (his parents are Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith), and you don’t have to look hard to see traces, especially, of his father — the cool glare of appraisal, the quickness of his fury. With his nifty cornrows (a junior rapper’s ‘do that marks how much he’s grown up since The Pursuit of Happyness), Smith looks like an intensely aware goldfish. As Dre, he gets knocked down by bullies and drawn to the sweet sparkle of a teen violinist, but whomever he shares the screen with, he combines a kid’s directness with an adult’s way of holding himself in check. Though it’s not too varied a performance, Smith, like his father, acts with an emotional ease that’s almost gymnastic.\n\nA remake of the 1984 go-for-it classic, the new Karate Kid is longer than the original film (it’s 140 minutes) and a couple of shades more downbeat, with Dre as a lonely Odd Kid Out in the bustling bureaucratic China that is his new home. Jackie Chan has a corresponding melancholy as the maintenance man who teaches Dre the art of kung fu. (Yes, they should have called it The Kung Fu Kid — but you don’t mess with brand titles like this one.) All in all, The Karate Kid is a more somber, less playful movie than the original, but at heart it’s the same old irresistible candy corn.\n\nI did, for a while, miss the sly, poker-faced humor that Pat Morita brought to the role of Mr. Miyagi. When Chan’s Mr. Han begins Dre’s training by ordering him to hang his jacket on a hook, then throw it on the floor, pick it up, and do it all again and again, it’s a variation on the wax-on, wax-off gimmickry of the first film. Morita, though, let us know that he was enjoying the slightly sadistic joke of the Zen discipline he was enforcing. Chan, in a scruffy goatee, plays Han as very serious, almost morose, in his mission. He makes the guru-mentor slightly damaged goods; Han needs this kid as much as the kid needs him. Their earnestness grows on you, though. The bond these two share is sincere and touching.\n\n \n \nThe movie builds, of course, to the big kung fu tournament, in which Dre finally faces down a bully who has been trained to fight with ”no mercy.” It’s a piece of inspirational hokum that works nicely, though I do wish the film had been a bit more ingenious about shoehorning in the famous Ralph Macchio ”crane” stance. That said, The Karate Kid is fun, and believable, on the most important level: It convinces us that Jaden Smith has what it takes to fight his way to the top. B" + "“Kid” might also find an audience among devotees of the John G. Avildsen-directed original (and, to a lesser extent, its three increasingly disposable sequels). While it’s easy to laugh now at that film’s ’80s accoutrements and “Rocky”-for-runts uplift, its blend of earnest naivete and underdog-saga manipulation still goes down pretty smoothly, thanks to the warm yin-yang rapport of leads Ralph Macchio and Morita.\n\nAs helmed by Harald Zwart (“Agent Cody Banks,” “One Night at McCool’s”) from a script by Christopher Murphey, this remake is an even more calculated item — shrewdly updated for our era of globalization, dislocation and parkour, but engineered to deliver the same dramatic satisfactions as the original, almost beat for beat. A reassuring familiarity seeps in as early as the opening frames, when we meet 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith), who’s far less excited than his mother, Shelly (a wonderful Taraji P. Henson), about their move from Detroit to Beijing.\n\nDre has barely mastered chopsticks when he becomes smitten with cute violinist Meiying (Han Wenwen), only to immediately run afoul of some aggressive young thugs led by Cheng (Wang Zhenwei), who subjects the shrimpy foreigner to a merciless demonstration of his kung fu prowess. Indeed, “The Kung Fu Kid” would have made a more accurate if less marketable title, as Mr. Han (Chan), a local maintenance man and dormant kung fu master, reluctantly takes Dre under his wing in hopes of getting him in shape for an upcoming martial-arts tournament.\n\nSo as to teach his disciple the importance of focus, obedience, inner strength and oneness with nature, Mr. Han takes Dre on several excursions to the scenic Wudang Mountains and, inevitably, the Great Wall, one of many easy-access cultural cliches on display here. (Among the lessons in store for impressionable youngsters in the audience: Chinese people are skillful classical musicians, value family honor above all else and really enjoy touching black people’s hair.)\n\nWhile there’s a potentially compelling movie to be made about an African-American adolescent struggling to adjust to life in urban China, “Kid’s” engagement with its setting never goes far beyond the picturesque (and, as lensed by Roger Pratt in such locations as the Forbidden City, it is picturesque indeed). Scenic training montages aside, there’s never the sense that Dre is learning anything meaningful from his new surroundings (like the language, for starters) that will benefit him in the real world, once he’s beaten the bad guys.\n\nApart from routine attacks by pint-sized flying ninjas, Dre has it pretty easy: Never a scrap of homework, and just about all the locals revert to English in his presence. (Even tough guy Cheng seems weirdly accommodating when he snarls things like, “You are fast, but not fast enough!”)\n\nAll of which is to say that “The Karate Kid: Foreign-Exchange Edition” is essentially a glossy Far East fairy tale and, as such, its appeal rests on the flexed shoulders of its lead actors, both of whom have the unenviable task of stepping into iconic roles and acquit themselves reasonably well. Smith is saddled with a bit too much defensive/bratty attitude early on, but the plucky young actor comes into his own when the role’s estimable physical demands set in (Smith learned kung fu from Chan’s regular stunt coordinator, Wu Gang).\n\nIdeally cast as a martial-arts maven who’s seen better days, Chan initially channels Morita in his use of terse, vaguely Buddhist aphorisms before his instinctive warmth and good humor as a performer take over. Thesp even manages to sock over the moment when Mr. Han boozily discloses a traumatic memory — a scene that didn’t work especially well in the original and still feels tacked-on here.\n\nOverall, the filmmakers have largely opted to embellish rather than excise, suggesting their reluctance to depart much from the original template. Still, it’s a sign of that pic’s dramatic durability that “Kid” manages to be as absorbing as it is, despite its nearly 2½-hour running time, and that the climactic tournament (now with instant replay) sustains interest even when it’s clear when and where the blows will land.\n\nHenson offers rock-solid support, while Han could hardly be more winning as Dre’s love interest. In lieu of the original’s Joe Esposito, the soundtrack includes tunes by John Mayer, AC/DC and the ubiquitous Justin Bieber, classily offset by some welcome snatches of Chopin and Rachmaninoff." + "In today’s risk-averse movie business, we’re seeing more remakes than ever, including retreads of films that don’t seem that old (to some of us). After a screening of the new Karate Kid I asked a couple of ten-year-old boys if they knew the 1984 movie, and they did, thanks to DVDs and cable TV reruns. Interestingly enough, neither one wanted to compare one version with the other: they like them both. I do, too.\n\nThe original Karate Kid, written by Robert Mark Kamen and directed by John Avildsen (in the same mold as his first smash hit, Rocky), was a shamelessly manipulative but well-told story, perfectly cast, with Ralph Macchio as a boy who needs to learn how to defend himself and Noriyuki “Pat” Morita as his unlikely mentor in martial arts, Mr. Miyagi. (In real life, Macchio told me the other night, Morita “couldn’t touch his toes.”)\n\nThat premise is the only tangent that connects the 1984 hit and its new incarnation, written by Christopher Murphey and directed by Dutch ex-pat Harald Zwart, whose previous American credits include—\n\n—such undistinguished fare as Agent Cody Banks and The Pink Panther II. This expert, if overlong, piece of entertainment is likely to propel both men to the front ranks of commercial moviemaking. It’s a winner.\n\nA great deal of credit goes to the film’s two stars. Jaden Smith, Will Smith’s 11-year-old son, reveals a level of charisma and screen presence that was only hinted at when he appeared with his father in The Pursuit of Happyness. It’s often been said that juvenile performances can be cobbled together in the editing room; I don’t think that’s the case here. This young man has what it takes.\n\nJackie Chan is likable and persuasive as his teacher, an introverted maintenance man at the Beijing apartment building where Smith and his mom (Taraji P. Henson) come to live after leaving Detroit behind. Chan’s character undergoes as great a transformation as Smith’s in this screenplay, and it’s enjoyable to watch because he is such an appealing actor—and still supple enough to kick butt when the occasion demands.\n\nThe new Karate Kid takes its time establishing its story building-blocks, and stretches out its climax, with a kung fu tournament that’s much more violent and bone-crunching than the one I remember from the first movie and its two sequels. The underlying messages of courage and honor still come through, although they’re a bit muddy at times.\n\nWhat matters most in a film like this is rooting interest, and that is firmly established and well played out, with appropriate doses of villainy and puppy love. The most important new ingredient is the Chinese setting, and Smith’s position as a fish out of water dealing with a country, and culture, he doesn’t know or understand.\n\nI could find nits to pick, but they pale alongside this film’s exuberance and entertainment value for a broad audience. The Karate Kid deserves the success it’s bound to enjoy."
